# Binary Converter App

A simple Flutter application that converts decimal numbers to binary format. The app follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern and includes input validation logic to ensure users enter valid decimal numbers for conversion.

## Features

- Converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent.
- Follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architectural pattern for a clean and maintainable codebase.
- Input validation to ensure only valid decimal numbers are entered.

## Structure

The app is divided into three main components, following the MVC pattern:

- **Model**: Contains the logic for converting the decimal number to binary.
- **View**: Displays the user interface and communicates with the Controller.
- **Controller**: Manages user interactions, invokes the Model for conversion, and updates the View accordingly.
